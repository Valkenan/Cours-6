The International Day of Peace at the United Nations
On International Peace Day, the United Nations asks for
 a 24-hour ceasefire of all hostilities around the world.
 It also asks people to observe one minute of silence at noon to honour victims
 of war and violence. The day begins with the Peace Bell Ceremony at the United
 Nations headquarters. The Peace Bell was donated by the United Nations Ass
 ociation of Japan in June 1954 and is made of metal that includ
 es coins contributed by people from 65 member countries. The
 bell is a symbol of hope for peace and is rung several times a
 year, including on International Peace Day. After the bell has bee
 n rung, the UN Secretary-Genera
 l delivers a message.
